# getting-things-done
(CS 50 Final Project) Web implementation of the GTD-method by David Allen

I used Python and Djano to create a To-Do-List website that is compatible with the "Getting Things Done" method by David Allen.

You create a new item for the To-Do-List by submitting it in the inbox view.

When you click on the item itself, you can edit three fields:
* the next step
* project category
* due date

You can filter your items by date, category and status (marked as done or paper bin).

Every item has buttons for quick deleting or marking as done.
